# Do Now Disturb

This tiny program adds a custom tile to turn on/off the ‘Do Not Disturb’
mode. Once the silent mode is turned on, user can select automatic
turn off time.

Hence this application is similar to the popular [Shush!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.publicobject.shush&hl=pl)
application, however it is designed for the new Android ‘Do Not Disturb’
mode.
